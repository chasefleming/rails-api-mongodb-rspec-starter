== README

This starting template is for those looking to build projects with Rails just as a backend and save themselves the time and hassle of setting up MongoDB and Rspec along with it. The three main features of this starter template are:

* [Rails API](github.com/rails-api/rails-api) - (Backend Rails)
* Mongoid (for MongoDB)
* Rspec

*You may want to change the mongoid config database names after cloning.*
